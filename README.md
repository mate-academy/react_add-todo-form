## Demo link

Add link here: `[DEMO LINK](https://<your_account>.github.io/<repo_name>/)`

## Task

Implement ability to add TODOs to the `TodoList` implemented in [Static list of todos](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_static-list-of-todos)

1. Create `App` components storing `todos` array and displaying it with `TodoList`
2. Create `NewTodo` component with a form to add new TODOs
   - please add labels and placeholders where it is needed
   - each TODO show have a `title` and `userId` selected from a list of given `users` (`./src/api/users.js`)
   - show user names in `<select>`
   - the `TODO` should be added to the list after clicking `Add` button
   - `App` should add integer `id` to each TODO (starting from `1`)
3. Clear the form after adding a TODO
4. Add validation to the form
   - add an empty option `Choose a user` to the users select
   - before creating a user check if a `user` was selected, if not show an error next to `select` (Please choose a user)
   - if a title is empty show an error (Please enter the title)
   - errors should appear only after pressing `Add` button
5. Hide an error immediately when you edit a field with an error
6. (\* Optional) Limit characters displayed in the `title` field.
   Allow entering `spaces` and alphanumeric (`\w`) characters.

## Workflow

- Fork the repository with task
- Clone forked repository
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:<user_name>/<task_repository>.git
  ```
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Then develop

## Development mode

- Run `npm start` to start development server on `http://localhost:3000`
  When you run server the command line window will no longer be available for
  writing commands until you stop server (`ctrl + c`). All other commands you
  need to run in new command line window.
- Follow [HTML, CSS styleguide](https://mate-academy.github.io/style-guides/htmlcss.html)
- Follow [the simplified JS styleguide](https://mate-academy.github.io/style-guides/javascript-standard-modified)
- run `npm run lint` to check code style
- When you finished add correct `homepage` to `package.json` and run `npm run deploy`
- Add links to your demo in readme.md.
  - `[DEMO LINK](https://amserhii11.github.io/react_add-todo-form/)` - this will be a
    link to your index.html
- Commit and push all recent changes.
- Create `Pull Request` from forked repo `(<branch_name>)` to original repo
  (`master`).
- Add a link at `PR` to Google Spreadsheets.
